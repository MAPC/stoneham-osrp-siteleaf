### The Town of Stoneham has partnered with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC.org) to update its 1997 Open Space and Recreation Plan (OSRP). A lot in Stoneham has changed since 1997: the town’s evolving demographics means its residents will have different needs in both active and passive recreation, and local and regional growth patterns demand more proactive planning to ensure natural and scenic resources are protected for future generations to enjoy. The OSRP update process will allow residents to collectively identify local priorities and set forth a seven-year action plan to preserve, add, and improve community assets that makes a Stoneham a great place to live.

### This project is funded by the Commonwealth’s Community Compact Grant and MAPC’s Technical Assistance Program. The project timeline begins in January 2017 and ends in June 2017. 

### Steering Committee Members:
* George Seibold, Selectmen
* Megan Day, Conservation Commission
* Rachel Renard, Conservation Commission
